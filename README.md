### About This App
The Sorting Hat uses a card building function and a random number generator to asign a Hogwarts house to the name of the student entered in a small form.  Before the app loads, instructions are presented on a Jumbotron.  All styling, including the cards, form, and jumbotron are provided by Bootstrap.
